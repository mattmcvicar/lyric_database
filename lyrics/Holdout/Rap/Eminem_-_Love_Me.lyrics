[INTRO]
You don't see me in the hood
It's cause I'm doing this man

[VERSE]
Niggers, I'm still grinding, yeah
I'm still hearing those sirens,
I'm still getting chased by those lights,
Only the light's lime and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more,
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business,
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, for sure
and I can't let y'all derail me man, 
I got young Kobe, hommie, you gotta let go of Obie
cause Obie be back, ain't goin' nowhere man
We got them craps going on
and that yak going on,
soon as a nigger touch down back from tourin',
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar man,
but in the meantime, it's Jimmy Ivene time,
chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out,
this is it my nigger, this what we boast about,
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
And show me love bitch

[CHORUS]
I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life, I dont love you bitch
I wanna hold you in the morning, Haha
hold haha you through the night right
we wanna love I just wanna love you alcohol we wanna love guns,
we wanna love I wanna hold money you in the morning uh huh huh
we don't wanna love no bitches through the night

[VERSE]
There's a certain mystique when I speak
that you notice that it's sorta unique
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
and I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat
you can't sit still, it's like tryin' to smoke crack
and go to sleep, I'm strapped
just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
it ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamamie
you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten kaboodle
I'm just brutal It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
there's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
you better love me bitch

[CHORUS]
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
hold you through the night
and all the bitches say
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the morning
hold you through the night

[VERSE]
my boyz is crazy in the hood, they holler my name
if it ain't about the flow
it's about the stones and the chain yeah
if I was you, I'd love me too
I roll like a boss, nine eleven pulse same color as cranberry sauce woo
I ain't gonna front, I thought R Kelly was the shit
then we find out he fucking round with bow wow bitch
niggers eatin' popcorn, right, rewinding the tape
now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin' rape
i'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose, God Damn
used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet
then the bitch put out a C D that didn't have no beats uh huh
that boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail
that nigger went butt-ass for his record to sell
my back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
and Big Ben taught Charlie B more to deepthroat
yeah

[CHORUS]
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I luv'a burnish the monies, the bunnies
I just wanna hold ya
hold you through the night
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life
I just wanna hold ya in the morning
hold you through the night
yeah
