[INTRO]
Yo, yo, move out the way we got Missy Elliot commin' through 
Girl that is Missy Elliot, she lost a lot of weight, 
I heard she eat one cracker a day
Girl, what I heard the bitch was married to Tim, 
and started fuckin' wit Trina 
Well I heard the bitch got hit by three zebras and a monkey 
I can't stand the bitch no way 

[VERSE]
When I walk up in the peace 
I ain't gotta even speak 
Im a bad mamma jamma god dammit motherfucker 
You aint gotta like me

Need to talk, what ya know 
Stop talking bout who I'm stickin' I'm lickin' 
You just mad it ain't yours

Y'all jobs just hangin' up coats ah woo
Step to me get burnt like toast ah woo

Who I'm roll up in the club with and report that next week 
Just wanna see who I am or sniffin' some coke 
I know by the time I finish this line I'mma hear this on the radio
OK
Once upon a time in Kyla park 
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark 
There was a little nigger by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind 
No one gave a shit 
Knowing he could rap 
No one lend a hand 
So he went about his business 
And devised the plan 
Made a C D then he hit the block 
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop 
Hold the phone, uh three years later 
Stepped out the swamp with ten and a half gators 
Now all around the world on the microphone 
He leaves the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne 
Still ride the chrome 
Got bitches in the kitchen 
Never home alone 
And he's on the grind 
Please let me know if he's on your mind 
And respect you'll gimme 
Ludacris, I live loud like timmy uh
Had to clear these rumors 
I got a headache and its not a tumor 
Get up on my lap get my head tucked tight 
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite 
I'm hard to the core 
Core to the right 
You drop down turn around pick up hella clip 
Ya ya ya

[OUTRO]
