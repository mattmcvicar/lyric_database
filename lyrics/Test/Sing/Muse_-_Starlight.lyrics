Far away 
The ship is taking me far away 
Far away from the memories 
Of the people who care if I live or die 
The starlight 
I will be chasing a starlight 
Until the end of my life 
I don't know if it's worth it anymore 
Hold you in my arms 
I just wanted to hold 
You in my arms 
My life 
You electrify my life 
Let's conspire to ignite 
All the souls that would die just to feel alive 
Now I'll never let you go 
If you promised not to fade away 
Never fade away 
Our hopes and expectations 
Black holes and revelations 
Our hopes and expectations 
Black holes and revelations 
Hold you in my arms 
I just wanted to hold 
You in my arms 
Far away 
The ship is taking me far away 
Far away from the memories 
Of the people who care if I live or die 
And I'll never let you go 
If you promise not to fade away 
Never fade away 
Our hopes and expectations 
Black holes and revelations 
Our hopes and expectations 
Black holes and revelations 
Hold you in my arms 
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
I just wanted to hold
