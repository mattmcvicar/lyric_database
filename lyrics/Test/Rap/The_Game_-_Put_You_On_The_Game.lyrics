The beach cruiser, got em puttin red and blue
Strings in they g-units. get groupie luv,
Tell em to keep movin, if I gotta problem wit a bitch
I let eve do it. unless she got on La Perla
And I can see through it, I don't just let her ride
I give her the keys to it. me n my bitch layed back
In the coupe, I'm movin in the neighborhood I ain't
Passin through. I woulda been here afta snoop,
But I slowed down and showed timbaland how to iron a khaki suit.
[Chorus]
