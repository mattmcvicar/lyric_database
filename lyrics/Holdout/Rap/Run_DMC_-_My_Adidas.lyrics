My Adidas
Walk through concert doors
And roam all over coliseum floors
I stepped on stage, at Live Aid
All the people gave an applause that paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak
My Adidas cuts the sand of a foreign land
With mic in hand I cold took command
My Adidas and me both askin P
We make a good team my Adidas and me
We get around together, rhyme forever
And we won't be mad when worn in bad weather
My Adidas
My Adidas
My Adidas
Standin on 2 Fifth St.
Funky fresh and yes cold on my feet
With no shoe string in em, I did not win em
I bought em off the Ave with the tags still in em
I like to sport em that's why I bought em
A sucker tried to steal em so I caught em and I thwart em
And I walk down the street and I bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet
And now I just standin' here shooting the gif
Me and D and my Adidas standing on 2 Fifth
My Adidas
My Adidas
Now
Me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel, drit road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page every show I go
It's Adidas on my feet high top or low
My Adidas
My Adidas
Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare
Myself homeboy got fifty pair
Got blue and black cause I like to chill
And yellow and green when it's time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when I'm playin' ball
With the heal inside make me ten feet tall
My Adidas only bring good news
And they are not used as selling shoes
They're black and white, white with black stripe
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of our famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows we're good if you know what I mean
We started in the alley, now we chill in Cali
And I won't trade my Adidas for a ??
My Adidas
