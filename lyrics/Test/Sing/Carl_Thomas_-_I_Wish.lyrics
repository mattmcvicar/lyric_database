It was love at first sight 
I know from the way she looked at me 
Her eyes said it all 
Long days and nights, we spent 
Until she dropped the bomb on me 
When she said that she 
Was unhappily married with children 
[Chorus] 
And I wish I never met her at all 
Even though I love her so 
She got love from me 
But she still belongs to someone else 
It hurts so bad, for sure 
Because she wants to be with me 
But she cannot be with me 
She chose to stay, at home 
So they could be a family 
For the children 
But what about me? 
[Chorus] 
Maybe in another life 
Things could be the way we both desired 
It's a catch-22 
Either way it went 
Someone had to lose 
[Chorus:Repeat x2] 
I wish I wish I never met her at all 
I wouldn't hurt so much inside 
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain 
If I never met her at all, at all, at all 
Wish I never, wish I never
