What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now
No more gas in the rig
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
Out my life, out my head
Don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane
Yeah
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnectin' your call
Your phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh.
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster
Put on your pretty lies
We're in the city of wonder (City of lights)
Ain't gonna play nice (oh)
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice (think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise (be wise)
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia

Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain
But I'm struggling
If you can't go, go, go
I think I'm gonna oh, oh, oh
Put on your pretty lies
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice (better think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise (if you must falter be wise)
Your mind is in disturbia
