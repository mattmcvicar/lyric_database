[INTRO]
Uh, woo

[VERSE]
Drivin' around, I've got my baby and my top down
Merry-go-round, I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound, I make it for my love
Makin' my way, I brake another L A day
Time in the town, I need you for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love
Who, who you talkin' to? Talkin' to, talk to me you, to me you
Sound of music
Who, who you talkin' to? Talkin' to, talk to me you, to me you
Sound of music

[CHORUS]
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me

[VERSE]
Sought and I found a life of makin' my blood sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in sensoround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
Who, who you talkin' to? Talkin' to, talk to me you, to me you
Sound of music
Who, who you talkin' to? Talkin' to, talk to me you, to me you
Sound of music

[CHORUS]
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me, yeah
