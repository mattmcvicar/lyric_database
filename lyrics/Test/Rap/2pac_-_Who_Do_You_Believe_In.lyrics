[INTRO]
Let us pray
Heavenly Father, hear a nigger down here
Before I go to sleep
huh huh huh
Tell me, who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Hey

[VERSE]
I see mothers in black cryin', brothers in packs dyin'
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God 'cause we livin' in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin' bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin' for
Is it the miniature caskets, it's little babies
Victims of a stray from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin' fact stay high explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer
Who do you believe in?

[CHORUS]
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?

[VERSE]
Can't close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
'Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin' the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessey and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin' if I'm worthy
Livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me
So I'm askin' before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change? I'm askin'
Who do you believe in?

[CHORUS]
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?

[VERSE]
Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
'Cause so far I done witnessed too many dead niggers in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin' down camp, still mashin'
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of ninety five back in Yardsville stuck
With a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
If you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin'
Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
'Cause he just came home off of bail
Now tell me
Who do you believe in?

[CHORUS]
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?

[INTERLUDE]
Is it Buddha, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?
Is it Jesus? Is it God? Or is just yourself?
Definitely not to be imposed being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing
Men to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul of the man, for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand, that every man, is his own man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man
Who do you believe in?

[CHORUS]
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
blessed and still breathin'
Even though it's hard
Who do you believe in? Who do you believe in? Put my faith in God
Before I'm leavin'
Even though it's hard
I'm asking
Before I'm leavin'
I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you
Blessed and still breathin'
Oh blessed
Before I'm leavin' I'm askin' the grievin' who do you believe in?
who do you
