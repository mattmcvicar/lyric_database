Yo, yo, move out the way we got Missy Elliot commin' through 
Girl that is Missy Elliot, she lost a lot of weight, 
I heard she eat one cracker a day! 
Girl, what I heard the b_tch was married to Tim, 
and started f_ckin' with Trina 
Well I heard the b_tch got hit by three zebras and a monkey 
I can't stand the b_tch no way 
When I walk up in the peace 
I ain't gotta even speak 
Im a bad mamma jamma god damnit muthafucka 
You aint gotta like me 
I aint sweatin these hoes 
Need to talk, what ya know 
Stop talking bout who Im stickin im lickin 
You just mad it aint yours

Yall jobs just hangin up coats 
Step to me get burnt like toast

Now I don't go out my house shorty you just waitin to see 
Who im roll up in the club with and report that next week 
Just wanna see who I am ******* or sniffin some coke 
I know by the time I finish this line ima hear this on the radio
Once upon a time in Kyla park 
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark 
There was a little n_gga by the name of 'cris 
Nobody paid him any mind 
No one gave a shit 
Knowing he could rap 
No one lend a hand 
So he went about his business 
And devised the plan 
Made a CD then he hit the block 
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop 
Hold the phone, three years later 
Steped out the swamp with ten and a half gators 
Now all around the world on the microphone 
He leaves the booth smellin like Burberry cologne 
Still ride the chrome 
Got bitches in the kitchen 
Never home alone 
And hes on the grind 
Please let me know if hes on your mind 
And respect youll gimmie 
Ludacris, I live loud like timmy 
Had to clear these rumors 
I got a headache and its not a tumor 
Get up on my lap get my head tucked tight 
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite 
Im hard to the core 
Core to the right 
You drop down turn around pick up hella clip (yaaaa) 
echo: yahh! 
[Chorus]
