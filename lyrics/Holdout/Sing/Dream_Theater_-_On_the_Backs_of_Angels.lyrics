Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight
We spiral towards disaster
Survival fading faster
Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Bleeding us to death
The new American dream
You're blinded by your hunger
Beware, your days are numbered
Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me
Guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Blurring lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on parade are stringing us along
We're on to your agenda
The dead-end road to nowhere
Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me
Guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me
Lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
