I'm looking for the right woman to give my last name. 
I wanna a big wedding with all the expensive rings, 
Huge ice sculptures spelling out yo name, white doves flying, 
Tears without the pain. 
I'm standing at the alter you walking down the lane 
The whole church crying while the choir sing. 
75 thousand dresses expensive champagne 
I'm just playing baby 
This is the year of the lover 
Now I can put your ass out, ohhh 
Keep running your mouth 
And if yo brothers come trippin ima show em wat dese teardrops bout 
Shawty I was just playing 
Ohh but I can take you to the Caymen... islands 
Have you screamin' and hollerin' 
We gone be making... Love on the beach 
The people see what we doin 
Awww they pointin' and oooo'in 
Ohh but we gone keep on doing... it 
Like it's just me and you and no one else around 
It went down on the balcony, 
And her legs are open how Sweet, 
Shawty like a model out da Penthouse Sheets, 
That's why I got her on my Penthouse Sheets. 
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see 
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be 
And I apologize if this message gets you down 
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and 
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling 
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island 
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy 
Give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back 
Spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors 
They dip as quick as they can

The atmosphere is now ripped 
Im so like a Pip, Im glad its night 
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum 
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom 
Like a premie out the womb 
My partner yellin "Too soon! Dont do it! Reconsider! 
Read some litera - ture on the subject 
You sure? Fuck it 
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic 
If that bitch do you dirty 
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent 
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar 
I know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya 
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart 
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart 
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart 
Play your part  
[Common] 
Are we living in a dream world? 
Are your eyes still green girl? 
I know your sick and tired of arguing 
But you can't keep it bottled in 
Jealousy, we got to swallow it 
Your heart and mind baby follow it 
Smile, happiness you could model it 
And when you feel opposite 
I just want you to know 
Your whole being is beautiful 
Im going to do the best I can do 
Cause i'm the best when i'm with you 
You help me to discovery me 
I just want you to put trust in me 
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me 
The aftermath is you touching me 
It's destiny to we connected girl 
You and i we can affect the world 
I'm tired of the fast lane 
I want you to have my last name
