[VERSE]
Whenever I'm with him woo hoo hoo
Something inside inside starts to burnin' woo hoo hoo
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

[CHORUS]
It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart like a heat wave
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearin' me apart

[VERSE]
Whenever he calls my name
Soft, low, sweet and plain
I feel, right there
I feel that burnin' flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

[CHORUS]
It's like a heat wave
Burnin' in my heart like a heat wave
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearin' me apart

[INTERLUDE]
hoo hoo hoo
woo heat wave
hoo hoo hoo
hoo heat wave

[VERSE]
Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it
Don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now that funny feelin' has me amazed
don't know what to do
My head's in a haze

[CHORUS]
It's like a heat wave
Burnin', right here in my heart
It's like a heat wave
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearin' me apart
