[INTRO]
Yeah, C'mon
I need a, I want a

[CHORUS]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife I need a 
I need a girl who's mine oh mine gotta have her
I need a girl in my life

[VERSE]
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy that's not what my plans be
Need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin' me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Maybe's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin' me
That's why I need me a girl that be true to me
Know 'bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word girl, it's just you and me
Now let's ride

[CHORUS]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride me
I need a girl to make my wife I need a girl
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride me
I need a girl to be my wife I need a girl
she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

[VERSE]
Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, I know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'mma keep her
'cause now I'm gettin' money and the game gettin' deeper
Yo want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together feel so right
You the girl I been lookin' for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life
I need a girl

[CHORUS]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride me
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
nobody else, she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

[VERSE]
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Quarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers, oh
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers, oh
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile, oh
And how we used to drive the whole city wild, oh yeah yeah
Damn I wish you would've had my child c'mon
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's smile
This shit is wild
All dem days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips c'mon
But as long as you happy, I'mma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

[CHORUS]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
nobody else, she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride, ride ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
nobody else, she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride, ride ride
I need a girl to make my wife girl you make me
I need a girl who's mine oh mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life, oh
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife be my wife

Girl you mean so much to me
