Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Cause I was sittin' there bored to death 
And in just one breath he said 
You gotta get up 
You gotta get on 
You gotta get down girl 
You know you drive me crazy baby 
You've got me turning to another man 
Called you on the phone 
No one's home 
Baby why ya leave me all alone 
And if it wasn't for the music 
I don't know what I'd do 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life with a song 
You know I hopped into my car 
Didn't get very far no 
Because I had you on my mind 
Why be so unkind? 
You've got your women all around 
All around this town, boy 
But I was trapped in love with you 
And I didn't know what to do 
But when I turned on my radio 
I found out all I needed to know 
Check it out 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life with a song 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life from a broken heart 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
Last night a D-J saved my life with a song 
Hey listen up to your local D-J 
You better hear what he's got to say 
There's not a problem that I can't fix 
Cause I can do it in the mix 
And if your man gives you trouble 
Just you move out on the double 
And you don't let it trouble your brain 
Cause away goes troubles 
Down the drain 
I said away goes troubles 
Down the drain 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
There's not a problem that I can't fix 
Cause I can do it in the mix 
There's not a problem that I can't fix 
Cause I can do it in the mix 
Last night a D-J saved my life 
There's not a problem that I can't fix 
Cause I can do it in the mix 
There's not a problem that I can't fix 
Cause I can do it in the mix
