[VERSE]
When you grow up
Livin' like a good boy oughta
And your mama
Takes a shine to her best son
Something different
All the girls they seem to like you
'cause you're handsome
Like to talk and a whole lot of fun
But now your girl has gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said

[CHOURUS]
We're gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah, we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut
Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing oh the best we can
We're gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man

[VERSE]
It's a struggle
Livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer
Watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama
Heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you
That all she'd wanna do is cry
Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' over dressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just been towed

[CHOURUS]
We're gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah, we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut
Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing oh the best we can
gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man
Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing oh the best we can
gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man
