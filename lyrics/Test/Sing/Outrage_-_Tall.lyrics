[INTRO]
Now I'm looking for a good man
but not just any man
he's got to be someone special
someone who can light my body

[CHORUS]
He's gotta be tall and handsome
and he's gotta be free
He's gotta be tall and handsome
and he's gotta be free
He's gotta be tall and handsome
and he's gotta be free
He's gotta be tall and handsome
and he's gotta be free
Now I'm looking for a good man
but not just any man
he's got to be someone special
someone who can light my body

[OUTRO]
He's gotta be tall and handsome
He's gotta be tall and handsome
He's gotta be tall and handsome
He's gotta be tall and handsome
He's gotta be tall and handsome
He's gotta be tall and handsome
