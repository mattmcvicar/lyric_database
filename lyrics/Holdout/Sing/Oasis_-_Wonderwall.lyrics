[VERSE]
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now 
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now 
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
but I don't know how 

[CHORUS]
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall 

[VERSE]
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now 
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
but I don't know how 

[CHORUS]
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall 
I said maybe I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall 

[OUTRO]
I Said maybe, I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me that saves me
