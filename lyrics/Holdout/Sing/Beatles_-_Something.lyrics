[VERSE]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

[CHORUS]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[VERSE]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

[CHORUS]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[INTERLUDE]
You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[VERSE]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

[CHORUS]
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
