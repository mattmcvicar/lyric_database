[INTRO]
Yo man glorious
This is protected
by the red
And Tical
Slap it down
Way out of bound
Roll in a towel
Fo' we gun down
[VERSE]
Yo, flipmode,
toilet bowls explode
When Doc come drop a shit load
Grip fo's
Mushrooms, dick those
Deep pistol
Whip hoes
I bitch O's
Money, Roll, I stick a zipcode
Tiptoed, before Doc escape row
Thirsty, snippin' out a pig nose
My Benz too, with wings and 6-0's
My flows is North Pole cold
My hands got area's that fits snow
Doc, fixin' hoes in disco's
My dogs let 'em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, Niggas pack 6 rolls
We're losin' 'em
His hart won't get pulse
Pack you bags off a 10 percent doze
(?), I could hum and shit cold
[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
[VERSE]
I get scanned, rip sand
With this stick style
Pistol, lick ground
Get off my dick now
Kick crowd, hot style
You get shot style
Timid, scared to get in it
These dogs is rock rowd
Unchained, untained, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame
It's not a game
The ill flows, that kills shows
You can feel yo
Kickin' in you do', like a steel
Go for real dough
Y'all gonna learn I spit germs
When you come shot on Big Worm
You gets burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done
And get sun, come get some
The last victim lye in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nick
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get,
toxid
Up all the rightness
I'm chopstick
Go make your Wu just imposters
[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo yo, tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
[VERSE]
You try to O.K Corel
With Doc and Meth Tical
Barsaloon fight without weapons out
Strechmarks like Belly on Kevin ?Lous?
On yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Try to lock cash, bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jumpin', Meth shut 'em down
Pound to echo loud, bout 7 miles
Doc, dirty Jersey, hunt 'em down
Uncut rhymes, won't even fit your foul
Baddest man out the bunch, pick 'em out
Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch you mouth
Wilder then rhinos or liquor trous
Mrs. how Mary-Ann, dick 'em out
Ginger watch with the gun and skip a mouth
Love the ruckas and love to dish it out
3 watched MC's, start wristin' out
Get your whole camp put on the missile foul
Pushin' 12 out, bumpin' digital
[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
[VERSE]
We just ice
Men of mice, ain't nothing nice
Fuck you like
Your thight is to light to fight
We move right, on fright night
When Niggas write
We bust pipe, condo's that suck thight
We all right, you all hype and war's right
In the Source, with half mic, you half liked
And half dead, blasted on glass bed
eyes red, the hashhead
Burn somethin', earn somethin' and learn somethin'
Take my turn frontin'
Def Jam ain't heard nothin', yet
Suspect, ruffnecks
Buck 'em down or you get busted
Never leave home without my musket
Thrust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgement Day,
caught y'all proud
Take MC's to town if they start blawn
Ashes to ashes, they all fall ground
Master be basket with hazardous tactics
Send my automatic full rap metal jacket
Blasted in plastic your brain on the mattress
All you kids ask backwards and visa versa
[CHORUS]
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Yo, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
[OUTRO]
Come on, yo tear the roof off
Nigga, yo tear the roof off
Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
Huh
Yo, You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
Yo, You don't want to fuck with us
You don't
