[INTRO]
Here we go
we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
ya know what I'm sayin' Nuttin' but love for the old school
That's who we gonna do this one for, ya feel me?
Canned go, and B V D's an' shit
heh
ain't nuttin' like the old school

[VERSE]
I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
L L raisin' hell but, that didn't last
Eric B. and Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
and Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
when De La Soul was puttin' Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Houdini
had me puffin' on that buddha gettin' buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and M C Lyte
Listen to Treach, K R S to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit, nuttin' like the old school

[CHORUS]
nuttin' like the old school
nuttin' like the old school
yeah heh, it ain't nuttin' like the old school
nuttin' like the old school
the old school
heh

[VERSE]
Heh heh I had, Shell Toes, and B V D's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin' skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the tray bag
I'm on the train headin' uptown, freestylin'
with some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, Why them niggers swearin'?
I'm wonderin' if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin' up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigger tryin' to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin' nights, tryin' to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin' ninety proof, ain't nuttin' like the old school

[CHORUS]
nuttin' like the old school
ain't nuttin' like the old school

[INTERLUDE]
Hey rich, ain't nuttin' like the motherfuckin' old school nigger
An' I know you kinda like reminiscing when I just freak it to you like that, so why don't you flip that shit for these motherfuckers an' like, you know, really just let me them see how you picture the old school
'cause it ain't the same for every motherfucker, you feel me? So, er, take us back nigger

[VERSE]
remember poppin' and lockin' to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin' La Di Da Di
Gamin' the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remember
breakdancin' to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, L L when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the T V, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin' like the old school!

[CHORUS]
it ain't nuttin' like the old school
haha
it ain't nuttin' like the old school
hey, on the real though
ain't nuttin' like the old school

[OUTRO]
Ey I was at Lat quarters bigger when Eric B and Rakim did I ain't no joke for the first time
Ey remember motherfuckers used to get their gold chain snatched, remember that shit?
Remember seein' Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin' party?
Member how fuckers used to go, Is Brooklyn in the house?
and motherfuckers would lose they god damn mind
That's the old school to me that's what I'm sayin' 
I remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say
they was from anywhere but Brooklyn that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin' old school nigger
Remember skelly nigger?  Knockin' niggers out the box, poppin' boxes?
Member stickball?  Member niggers to run that shit like that?
Member the block members screamin' up at your mom from the window?
