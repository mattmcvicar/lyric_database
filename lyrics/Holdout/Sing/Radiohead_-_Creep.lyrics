[VERSE]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

[CHORUS]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[VERSE]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special

[CHORUS]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[INTERLUDE]
oh, oh
She's running out do do der,
She's running out
She run run run run
run

[VERSE]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I wish I was special

[CHORUS]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
