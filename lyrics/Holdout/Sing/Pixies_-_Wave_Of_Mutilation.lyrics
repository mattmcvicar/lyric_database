Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You'll think I'm dead, but I sail away
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
I've kissed mermaids, rode the el nino
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
