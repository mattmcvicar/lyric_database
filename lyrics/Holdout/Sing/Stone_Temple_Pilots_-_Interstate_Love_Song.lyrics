Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
for what I read between the lines
your lies.
feelin' like a hand in rusted shame
so do you laugh or does it cry?
reply?
Leavin' on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what I seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things you said to me.
Breathing is the hardest thing
to do. with all I've said and
all that's dead for you
you lied - good bye
Leavin' on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what I seemed to be
only watched the time go by,
all of these things I said to you.
