[INTRO]
oh

[VERSE]
Hey listen don't you let 'em get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always takin' baby out that's o k
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

[CHORUS]
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

[VERSE]
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load

[CHORUS]
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

[VERSE]
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line
Everyone who makes it in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

[CHORUS]
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Scream on
Scream in vengeance
Scream in vengeance
Scream on
