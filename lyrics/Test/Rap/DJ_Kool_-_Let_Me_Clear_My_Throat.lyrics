Yo here we go

At the count of three
I want everybody in the place to be
To make some noise if ya down with me

Some of y'all might be with this, and some of y'all won't
But listen, let me clear my throat
Oh, have mercy babe, Ha
I hope ya don't mind, let me clear my throat
Special dedication going out to everybody here in Bahama Bay
In Philadelphia
Here we go now, check it out, ah huh, ah huh, ah God Damn

[VERSE]
Yeah, rock to the rhythm of the funky rhyme
So I can get busy just one more time
To the beat and ya don't quit
It's that ol' school rap with that new school hit
Peter Piper picked a pepper but cool rocked the rhyme
And I can still rip up the house
Every God damn time I get on the mic, I go crazy
Peace out to Celo, Flex, and Doug Lazy
I betcha never knew but now ya know
I'm the undisputed king of this disco
And I never let the mic, magnetize me no more
'cause D J cool rip up the whole damn floor
Now I'mma rap a rhyme with the greatest of ease
And swing it like the man on the flying trapeze
And if you don't like it you grab on these
And now I need some help from the maestro please
Jam, Ha!  
So look it here check the flavor of the rhythm I wrote

[CHORUS]
And while I got a chance here, let me clear my throat
Oh, have mercy babe, ha
I hope ya don't mind, let me clear my throat

[INTERLUDE]

Music and the monitors
And it goes a little something like this here
Now if y'all want to party like we do
If y'all want to party like us, lemme hear ya say
Ah ah ah ah ah

When I say freeze y'all stop on a dime

If you got a job, you going to school
And y'all need nobody to help you handle your business
