oh--->
Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father has spoken
oh->
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
Heaven and Hell
Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives
Through blindness
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams
We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the Children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
Heaven and Hell
The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun
We were the Kings and Queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the Children of a Lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell
We are the Kings
We are the Queens
We are the Kings
We are the Queens
