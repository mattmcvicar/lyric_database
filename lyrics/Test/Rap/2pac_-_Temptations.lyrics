[INTRO]
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!
You know what time it is, booya
I know it's time to do
So grab one by the hand you know what I'm sayin'
And uh, throw up that finger hahaha
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
ha, yeah
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
C'mere

[VERSE]
Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
but the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand legit
I wanna be an honest man, but temptations goin'

[CHORUS]
Hey
Throw up the finger
Hey hey
And all my homies goin'
Hey hey
Give them the finger
hey
Ya know what baby it's like
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

[VERSE]
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
in my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin' I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was

[CHORUS]
Hey
Give 'em the finger
Hey hey
And all my homies goin' haha haha
Hey Go beyond broke baby
It's just the thug in me girl, you know
People like my homies know it's like
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money not me girl
But I can't be there what, and will you still care

[VERSE]
A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was

[CHORUS]
yeah, you know
Hey
Give 'em the finger
How how
And all my homies goin'
Hey hey
Hi
Hey that's how we game on it
check it out though
everybody hey how alright
