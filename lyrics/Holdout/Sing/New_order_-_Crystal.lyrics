We're like crystal
(Hey)
We break easy
(Hoo)
I'm a poor man
(Hey)
If you leave me
(Hoo)
I'm applauded
(Hey)
Then forgotten
It was summer
(Hey)
Now it's autumn
(Hoo)
I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love
It's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
(Hoo, hey)
We're like crystal
(Hey)
It's not easy
(Hoo)
With your love
(Hey)
You could feed me
(Hoo)
Every man
(Hey)
And every woman
(Hoo)
Needs someone
(Hey)
So keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love
It's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
I don't know what to say
You don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage
With a girl I betrayed
Here comes love
It's like honey
You can't buy it with money
You're not alone anymore
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
You shook me to the core
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
