(All right) 
(Come on) 
(Can you fill me in) 
I was checking this girl next door 
When her parents went out 
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around 
So I knock at the door 
You was standing with a bottle of red wine 
Ready to pour 
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor 
So I went in 
Then we sat down start kissing 
Caressing 
Told me about Jacuzzi 
Sounded interesting 
So we jumped right in 
All calls diverted to answerphone 
Please leave a message after the tone 
I'm not being mean 
Her Parents were kinda cool 
But they ran a fine line between me and you 
we were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to 
Saying why were you creeping round late last night 
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light 
Now you're dressed in black 
When I left you were dressed in white 
Can you fill me in 
Calls diverted to answerphone 
Red wine bottle half the contents gone 
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on 
Can you fill me in 
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out 
I'd say hey girl, come on right around 
So she knocked at the door 
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4 
Jumped in my ride 
Checking that nobody saw 
The club we went in 
We got down down down to the rhythm 
Saw it was early morning 
Thought we'd better be leaving 
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold 
Told you to wear it cause you felt cold 
I'm not being mean 
I didn't mean to break the rules 
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools 
We were just doing things young people end up doing 
Parents trying to find out what we were up to 
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more 
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4 
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door 
Can you fill me in 
Wearing a jacket who's property 
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi 
But you left all your money on the TV 
Can you fill me in 
(Can you fill me in) 
All they seem to do 
Is be checking up on you 
Baby 
(Craig David) 
Watching our every move 
Think some day they might approve 
Baby 
Why were you creeping round late last night 
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light 
Now you're dressed in black 
When I left you were dressed in white 
Can you fill me in 
(Can you fill me in) 
Calls diverted to answerphone 
Red wine bottle half the contents gone 
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on 
Can you fill me in 
(Can you fill me in)
