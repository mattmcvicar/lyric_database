[Verse]
Did you sleep on the wrong side? 
I'm catching a bad vibe 
And it's contagious, What's the latest? 
Speak your heart, Don't bite your tongue 
Don't get it twisted, Don't misuse it 
What's your problem? 
Lets resolve it 
We can solve it, What's the causes? 
It's official, You got issues 
I got issues, but I know I miss you 
[Chorus]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. 
[Verse]
I want to know: Where were you last night? 
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out 
I want to know: Were your fingers broke? 
If you had let me know, I wouldn't have put on my clothes   
I want to know: Where'd you go instead? 
Cause it was 4 in the morning, When you crept back in the bed 
I want to know: What was in your head? 
Or what was in my head? Am I supposed to change? 
[Chorus]
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? And will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? and who should be blamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Who should be ashamed? 
Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? 
Who should be hurt? Will we remain? 
You need a resolution, I need a resolution, 
We need a resolution, We have so much confusion. 
[Bridge]
Baby let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
You'll let me know, You'll let me know (I will) 
[Verse]
Girl holla!! 
You give me bits and pieces 
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason 
I think it's just the season, Maybe the month, Maybe the building 
Now tell me what's the reason? Snoop video? Looks are deceiving 
So, cut the crying, Cut the coughing, Cut the weazing, Girl 
Quit the blaming, Cut the naming, Cut the sleeping, Girl 
I think you need some prayer, Better call the deacon, Girl 
So, get your act right or else we won't be speaking, Girl 
So, what's it gonna be? Freaky, freaky... Me and you? 
Or is it gonna be who blames who? 
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars 
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow
