Baby, it's over
Tryin' to forget about
Ordinary things, typical, predictable
Baby, I knew the end before it started
You got me feelin' like I owed you something
'Cause you were there at times when I had nothing
But you threw it all away with the shady things you do
Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say and what I'm about to do
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true, ain't got no love for you
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
I ignore my intuition and pass it off as a suspicion
But you were just so bold, you kept puttin' it in my face
I can't deny I let you hurt me
Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say and what I'm about to do
I can't take no more
I know you ain't been true, ain't got no love for you
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
When you were down I helped to pick you up
Instead you kept lookin' for the one
When all the while what you were searching for
Was in front of your face
Just forget it, you'll regret it
It's really over now
Just turn around and watch me walk
I'm gone
You've been cheatin' 'round and tellin' me lies
And 'round
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
And 'round
And you've been sleepin' 'round and 'round
And messin' 'round
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
And 'round
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
