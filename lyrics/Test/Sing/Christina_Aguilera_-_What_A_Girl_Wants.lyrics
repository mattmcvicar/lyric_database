What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms, yeah, c'mon
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together, while I figured it out
I only looked, but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me you understand
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for bein' there for me
[Incomprehensible], but I walked away
But you had faith strong enough
To move over and give me space
While I got it together, yeah, while I figured it out
They say, if you love somethin', let it go
If it comes back, it's yours and that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willin' to give me more than
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for givin' it to me
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for bein' there for me
Oh baby, oh darlin', I thank you, thank you, oh yeah
I found me somebody sensitive and tough
Somebody down when the goin' gets rough
Every night he'll be givin' his love
To just warm down, warm down, warm
Somebody cool, [Incomprehensible] tender too
Somebody, baby, just like you
Can keep me hangin' around
With the one who always knew
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
Ooh, I'm thankin' you for bein' there for me
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
Whatever keeps me in your arms
Is what I need
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for givin' it to me
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for bein' there
What you got is what I need
All that you want
What I want, oh yeah
Oh baby, oh darlin', I thank you
Thank you for givin' me what I need
And for what I want, oh yeah
[Incomprehensible] whenever you're not there
[Incomprehensible] oh yeah
A girl wants
