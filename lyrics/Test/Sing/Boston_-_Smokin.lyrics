We're gonna play you a song, a little bit of rock-n-roll
You gotta let yourself go, the band's gonna take control.
We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight
Smokin', Smokin'
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'
Smokin', Smokin'
I feel alright, mamma I'm not jokin', yeah.
Get your feet to the floor, everybody rock and roll
You've got nothing to lose just the rhythm and blues, that's all, yeah
We're gonna feel ok
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight.
Smokin', Smokin'
We're cookin' tonight, just keep on tokin'
Smokin', Smokin'
I feel alright, mamma I'm not jokin', yeah.
Everyone's jumpin', dancin' to the boogie tonight
Clap your hands, move your feet
If you don't you know it won't seem right
We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight
We're gettin' down today
We'll pick you up and take you away
Get down tonight, well alright!
