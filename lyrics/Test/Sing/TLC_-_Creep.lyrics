Yes, it's me again
And I'm back
Creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby
Creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
Creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby
Creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
Creep
The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many thangs
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
'Cause I need some affection, oh
So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh, so I creep
The 23rd of loneliness
And we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty, strange but I'm not buggin'
'Cause I still feel, the same yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving
Till the day he pushes me away, never go astray
If he knew the things I did he couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him, protected, oh
So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
Oh, so I creep
I think about us baby all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah can you dig it
Love you forever baby, soul and mind
And you gotta know if
You don't give it I'm a, get mine
So I creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
So I creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
So I creep
Oh I, oh I, oh I, baby
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
So I creep
I creep around because I need some attention
Don't mess around with my affection
So I creep
I creep around because I need some attention
Don't mess around with my affection
So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
Oh I, oh I, oh I, yeah
So I creep, yeah
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
