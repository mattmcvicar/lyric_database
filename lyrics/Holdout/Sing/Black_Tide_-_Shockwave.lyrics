[VERSE]
I'm like a shockwave coming through your door
I'm like a bullet at the speed of light
I go around taking peoples lives
While you sit around saying lies
When I'm around you'll feel the pain
And when I'm done you will be no more
Your life is through now mine begins
My days of agony are now gone

[CHORUS]
I'm a shockwave and I don't need anyone
I'll follow my ways 'til the day I die
I'm a shockwave and I'll take your fuckin' life
Don't mess with me I'm a shockwave ready to kill

[VERSE]
I am the one who feeds off your life
I'll be right there when you're ready to die
I am a killer but they're all scared
When I rise no time is spared

[CHORUS]
I'm a shockwave and I don't need anyone
I'll follow my ways 'til the day I die
I'm a shockwave and I'll take your fuckin' life
Don't mess with me I'm a shockwave ready to kill
Shockwave

I'm a shockwave and I don't need anyone
I'll follow my ways 'til the day I die
I'm a shockwave and I'll take your fuckin life
Don't mess with me I'm a shockwave ready to kill
I'm a shockwave and I don't need anyone
I'll follow my ways 'til the day I die
I'm a shockwave and I'll take your fuckin life
Don't mess with me I'm a shockwave ready to kill
