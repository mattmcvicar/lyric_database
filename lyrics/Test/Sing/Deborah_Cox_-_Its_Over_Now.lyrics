[CHORUS]
I know you ain't been true, ain't got no love for you
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now

[VERSE]
Tryin' to forget about
Ordinary things, typical, predictable
Baby, I knew the end before we started, mmmm
You got me feelin' like I owed you something
'Cause you were there at times when I had nothing
But you threw it all away with the shady things you do
Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say and what I'm about to do
I can't take no more

[CHORUS]
I know you ain't been true, ain't got no love for you
been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
And you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now

[VERSE]
I ignore my intuition and pass it off as a suspicion
But you were just too bold, you kept puttin' it in my face
I can't deny I let you hurt me
Baby please forgive me
For what I'm about to say and what I'm about to do
I can't take no more

[CHORUS]
I know you ain't been true, ain't got no love for you
You been cheatin' and tellin' me lies
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night, oh
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
you been messin' 'round and I ain't down
It's over now
You've been cheatin' and tellin' me lies tellin' me lies tellin' me lies
And you've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night ooh baby
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
you've been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now, ooh

[INTERLUDE]
When you were down I helped to pick you up
Instead you kept lookin' for the one
When all the while what you were searching for
Was in front of your face
Just forget it, you'll regret it
It's really over now
'cause I'll be walkin' oh

[CHORUS]
You been cheatin' and tellin' me lies, oh yeah
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
you been messin' 'round and I ain't down
It's over now

You been cheatin' and tellin' me lies you been tellin' me
You've been creepin' while I'm sleepin' at night
And you've been chasin' every girl in sight
you been messin' 'round and lyin' down
It's over now
